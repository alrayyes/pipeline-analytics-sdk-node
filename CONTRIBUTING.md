## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3.14 — pinned via `packageManager` in
  `package.json` and `oven-sh/setup-bun` in CI. Bun 1.4 switched
  `bun.lock` to a new `lockfileVersion: 2` format that Dependabot's and
  Renovate's bundled Bun (1.3.x as of this writing) can't parse and
  silently corrupts back to v1 -- staying below 1.4 here keeps the
  dependency bot actually working (`rules/javascript.md`).
- [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook). `bun install` then
  `lefthook install` once, after cloning.

Bun is the runtime here, not just the package manager -- there's no Docker
wrapper the way this account's Go repos use one. A `go`/bun toolchain is
already on any machine doing that language's work, so hooks and CI run it
natively.

## Building and testing

```sh
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun x @biomejs/biome check .
bun run build
```

`lefthook run pre-push` runs the same set (plus `sort-package-json --check`),
so that's the one command to run before opening a pull request.

## Regenerating the types

`src/generated/schema.ts` is generated from `openapi/openapi.yaml` by
[openapi-typescript](https://openapi-ts.dev/) -- never hand-edit it. The spec
itself is pinned to a commit of
[alrayyes/pipeline-analytics](https://github.com/alrayyes/pipeline-analytics)
recorded in `openapi/SPEC_COMMIT`; `.github/workflows/regenerate.yml` bumps
that pin weekly and opens a pull request when pipeline-analytics' spec has
moved. To do it by hand:

```sh
./hack/fetch-spec.sh
bun run generate
```

Diff `openapi/openapi.yaml` (not the generated types) to decide whether a
change needs a major, minor or patch bump -- see
[`rules/sdk-generation.md`](https://git.higherlearning.eu/alrayyes/dotfiles/src/branch/master/private_dot_config/claude/rules/sdk-generation.md)'s
"Versioning tracks the contract, not the commits".

## Why openapi-typescript + openapi-fetch

`openapi-generator`'s generic TypeScript templates were considered and
rejected: its per-language templates are inconsistent in idiom quality, and
the generated TypeScript reads like every other language's client with the
syntax swapped rather than like hand-written TS. `openapi-typescript`
(types only, no runtime) plus `openapi-fetch` (a ~6&nbsp;KB typed wrapper
around the platform `fetch`) produces a client that's genuinely idiomatic
and has almost no dependency weight of its own -- see
[`rules/sdk-generation.md`](https://git.higherlearning.eu/alrayyes/dotfiles/src/branch/master/private_dot_config/claude/rules/sdk-generation.md)'s
"Generated vs hand-written" for the tradeoff this account weighs for every
generated SDK.

`src/generated/schema.ts` is the generated boundary -- types only. Every
other file under `src/` (the client wrapper, auth, retry, pagination, error
typing) is hand-written on top of it and is what the test suite actually
covers; testing the generated type mapping again would just be testing
openapi-typescript, not this SDK.

## Commits and releases

Commit messages follow [Conventional
Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), linted by commitlint on
`commit-msg`. Merging to `main` is what
[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) reads to keep
an open release pull request with the next version and changelog; merging
that pull request tags the release and publishes the package to npm.

## Branching

Every change lands through a pull request; nothing is pushed straight to
`main`.
